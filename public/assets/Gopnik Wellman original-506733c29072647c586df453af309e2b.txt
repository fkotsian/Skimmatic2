Do 
infants 
develop 
meaningful 
social 
preferences 
among 
novel 
individuals 
based 
on 
their 
social 
group 
membership? 
If 
so, 
do 
these 
social 
preferences 
depend 
on 
familiarity 
on 
any 
dimension, 
or 
on 
a 
more 
specific 
focus 
on 
particular 
kinds 
of 
categorical 
information? 
The 
present 
experiments 
use 
methods 
that 
have 
previously 
demonstrated 
infants’ 
social 
preferences 
based 
on 
language 
and 
accent, 
and 
test 
for 
infants’ 
and 
young 
children’s 
social 
preferences 
based 
on 
race. 
In 
Experiment 
1, 
10-month-old 
infants 
took 
toys 
equally 
from 
own-and 
other-race 
individuals. 
In 
Experiment 
2, 
2.5-year-old 
children 
gave 
toys 
equally 
to 
own-and 
other-race 
individuals. 
When 
shown 
the 
same 
stimuli 
in 
Experiment 
3, 
5-yearold 
children, 
in 
contrast, 
expressed 
explicit 
social 
preferences 
for 
own-race 
individuals. 
Social 
preferences 
based 
on 
race 
therefore 
emerge 
between 
2.5 
and 
5 
years 
of 
age 
and 
do 
not 
affect 
social 
choices 
in 
infancy. 
These 
data 
will 
be 
discussed 
in 
relation 
to 
prior 
research 
finding 
that 
infants’ 
social 
preferences 
do, 
however, 
rely 
on 
language: 
a 
useful

Introduction 
Adults’ 
social 
interactions 
with 
novel 
individuals 
are 
guided 
not 
only 
by 
the 
actions 
of 
those 
individuals, 
but 
also 
by 
the 
social 
categories 
to 
which 
they 
belong. 
Adults 
particularly 
attend 
to 
gender, 
race 
and 
age 
in 
evaluating 
people 
(Fiske, 
1998), 
and 
their 
social 
judgments 
are 
influenced 
by 
others’ 
language 
and 
accent 
as 
well 
(Giles 
& 
Billings, 
2004; 
Gluszek 
& 
Dovidio, 
2010). 
Research 
in 
developmental 
psychology 
suggests 
that 
category-based 
social 
preferences 
emerge 
early 
in 
development, 
and 
raises 
questions 
concerning 
the 
processes 
that 
produce 
these 
preferences. 
The 
present 
research 
attempts 
to 
shed 
light 
on 
the 
processes 
governing 
children’s 
social 
category-based 
preferences 
by 
assessing 
infants’ 
and 
young 
children’s 
social 
preferences 
based 
on 
race, 
in 
relation 
to 
prior 
work 
demonstrating 
young 
children’s 
preferences 
based 
on 
language 
and 
accent.

On 
one 
theory, 
infants 
and 
children 
tend 
to 
prefer 
people 
whose 
properties 
are 
most 
familiar 
to 
them. 
Familiarity, 
in 
this 
case, 
is 
not 
limited 
to 
or 
defined 
by 
any 
particular 
domain. 
Indeed, 
human 
preferences 
for 
the 
familiar 
are 
observed 
for 
non-social 
stimuli 
such 
as 
line 
drawings, 
polygons 
or 
words, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
social 
stimuli 
such 
as 
faces 
(Bornstein, 
1989; 
Harrison, 
1969; 
Rhodes, 
Halberstadt, 
& 
Brajkovich, 
2001; 
Zajonc, 
1968, 
2001). 
An 
early 
preference 
for 
the 
familiar 
might 
be 
adaptive 
given 
that 
entities 
that 
are 
familiar 
could, 
on 
average, 
be 
safer 
than 
the 
unknown. 
On 
a 
different 
theory, 
human 
social 
preferences 
might 
reflect 
preferences 
for 
and 
reasoning 
about 
social 
kinds 
(e.g., 
a 
naïve 
sociology 
that 
differs 
from 
reasoning 
about 
non-human 
kinds; 
Hirschfeld, 
1996). 
These 
early 
preferences 
for 
human 
kinds 
might 
even 
originate 
in 
a 
more 
specific, 
evolved, 
sensitivity 
to 
information 
that 
distinguished 
between 
categories 
of 
people 
within 
and 
across 
social 
groups 
throughout 
our 
evolutionary 
history. 
Within 
a 
single 
social 
community, 
all 
societies 
in 
all 
times 
are 
composed 
of 
individuals 
of 
varying 
gender, 
age, 
and 
kinship 
relationships, 
and 
so 
these 
factors 
may 
be

particularly 
psychologically 
prominent 
(Cosmides, 
Tooby, 
& 
Kurzban, 
2003; 
Kurzban, 
Tooby, 
& 
Cosmides, 
2001; 
Lieberman, 
Oum, 
& 
Kurzban, 
2008). 
Throughout 
ancient 
times, 
patterns 
of 
cooperation 
and 
competition 
would 
have 
served 
as 
good 
predictors 
of 
coalitional 
group 
membership 
across 
different 
social 
groups, 
and 
young 
children 
attend 
to 
these 
factors 
today 
(Cosmides 
et 
al., 
2003; 
Fehr, 
Bernhard, 
& 
Rockenbach, 
2008; 
Olson 
& 
Spelke, 
2008; 
Rhodes 
& 
Brickman, 
in 
press). 
Given 
the 
speed 
with 
which 
languages 
and 
accents 
evolve, 
and 
the 
apparent 
difficulty 
with 
which 
we 
learn 
a 
non-native 
accent 
as 
adults, 
language, 
too, 
may 
have 
served 
as 
a 
valid 
predictor 
of 
native 
group 
membership 
throughout 
our 
evolutionary 
history 
(Baker, 
2001; 
Henrich 
& 
Henrich, 
2007; 
McElreath, 
Boyd, 
& 
Richerson, 
2003; 
Pietraszewski 
& 
Schwartz, 
2007). 
Though 
race-based 
social 
categorization 
is 
certainly 
apparent 
in 
adults 
today, 
the 
aspects 
of 
visual 
appearance 
that 
distinguish 
members 
of 
different 
racial 
groups 
today 
were 
likely 
of 
little 
value 
in 
distinguishing 
members 
of 
neighboring 
coalitions 
in 
ancestral 
environments, 
prior 
to 
the 
onset 
of 
long-distance 
migration 
(Cosmides 
et 
al., 
2003; 
Kurzban 
et 
al., 
2001). 
Thus, 
though 
race 
may 
be 
an 
indicator 
of 
coalition 
in 
many 
societies 
today, 
we 
likely 
did 
not 
evolve 
to 
see 
race 
per 
se 
as 
a 
marker 
of 
group 
membership, 
and 
infants 
and 
young 
children 
may 
not 
intuitively 
award 
social 
importance 
to 
racial 
group 
membership. 


Research 
with 
children 
provides 
some 
support 
both 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
early 
familiarity 
preferences, 
and 
also 
for 
young 
children’s 
more 
specific 
preferences 
for 
certain 
social 
categories. 
First, 
considering 
preferences 
for 
familiar 
social 
others 
more 
generally, 
young 
infants’ 
visual 
preferences 
for 
the 
faces 
of 
novel 
individuals 
have 
been 
linked 
to 
the 
familiarity 
of 
the 
face 
categories. 
Infants 
of 
African 
descent 
look 
longer 
at 
own-race 
(Black) 
faces 
than 
at 
other-race 
(White) 
face 
if 
they 
reside 
in 
Africa, 
in 
a 
community 
in 
which 
faces 
of 
their 
race 
predominate, 
but 
Ethiopian 
infants 
born 
in 
Israel 
look 
equally 
to 
Black 
and 
White 
faces 
(Bar-Haim, 
Ziv, 
Lamy, 
& 
Hodes, 
2006; 
see 
also, 
Kelly 
et 
al., 
2005). 
Moreover, 
infants 
look 
longer 
at 
female 
faces 
than 
male 
faces 
if 
their 
primary 
caretaker 
is 
female, 
but 
may 
not 
show 
this 
preference 
if 
their 
primary 
caretaker 
is 
male 
(Quinn, 
Yahr, 
Kuhn, 
Slater, 
& 
Pascalis, 
2002; 
Ramsey-Rennels 
& 
Langlois, 
2006); 
furthermore, 
3-month-old 
infants 
display 
visual 
preferences 
based 
on 
gender 
only 
when 
tested 
with 
faces 
of 
a 
familiar 
race 
(Quinn 
et 
al., 
2008). 
By 
preschool 
age, 
children 
often 
demonstrate 
social 
preferences 
for 
individuals 
of 
their 
own 
gender, 
race, 
and 
age 
(Aboud, 
1988; 
Alexander 
& 
Hines, 
1994; 
Baron 
& 
Banaji, 
2006; 
French, 
1984; 
Katz 
& 
Kofkin, 
1997; 
Kircher 
& 
Furby, 
1971; 
Kowalski 
& 
Lo, 
2001; 
Maccoby 
& 
Jacklin, 
1987). 
Moreover, 
children’s 
preferences 
for 
the 
familiar 
may 
underlie 
the 
finding 
that 
in-group 
preferences 
based 
on 
race 
are 
stronger 
for 
majority-race 
children 
than 
for 
minority-race 
children 
(Cameron, 
Alvarez, 
Ruble, 
& 
Fuligni, 
2001). 
Finally, 
5–6 
month-old 
infants 
look 
longer 
at 
the 
face 
of 
a 
person 
who 
had 
previously 
spoken 
in 
their 
native 
language 
with 
a 
native 
accent, 
relative 
to 
a 
second 
person 
who 
previously 
spoke 
in 
a 
foreign 
language 
or 
accent 
(Kinzler, 
Dupoux, 
& 
Spelke, 
2007). 
Nevertheless, 
in 
each 
of 
the 
cases 
described 
above 
depicting 
infant 
research, 
it 
is 
not 
clear 
whether 
looking 
patterns 


in 
infancy 
are 
reflective 
of 
rich 
social 
preferences, 
or 
instead 
may 
reflect 
perceptual 
processing 
advantages, 
without 
any 
obligatory 
social 
meaning. 


Though 
children 
demonstrate 
preferences 
for 
the 
familiar 
based 
on 
multiple 
dimensions, 
children’s 
early 
social 
responses 
also 
reflect 
priorities 
in 
the 
importance 
they 
grant 
to 
different 
social 
categories 
(Kinzler, 
Shutts, 
& 
Correll, 
2010). 
Children 
show 
social 
preferences 
for 
same-
gender 
children 
by 
2–3 
years 
of 
age 
(e.g., 
Jacklin 
& 
Maccoby, 
1978; 
LaFreniere, 
Strayer, 
& 
Gauthier, 
1984); 
nevertheless, 
race-based 
preferences 
do 
not 
reliably 
emerge 
until 
closer 
to 
4 
or 
5 
years 
of 
age 
(Abel 
& 
Sahinkaya, 
1962; 
Aboud, 
2003; 
Brown 
& 
Johnson, 
1971; 
Kircher 
& 
Furby, 
1971; 
Stevenson 
& 
Stewart, 
1958). 
In 
a 
recent 
study, 
Shutts, 
Banaji, 
and 
Spelke 
(2010) 
directly 
compared 
the 
influence 
of 
gender, 
race 
and 
age 
on 
3-year-old 
children’s 
preferences 
for 
novel 
objects 
or 
activities 
that 
were 
endorsed 
by 
unfamiliar 
people 
who 
varied 
in 
gender, 
race 
and 
age. 
Gender 
and 
age, 
but 
not 
race, 
were 
robust 
guides 
to 
children’s 
choices. 
Similarly, 
5-year-old 
children 
express 
beliefs 
that 
gender 
categories, 
but 
not 
race 
categories, 
are 
objectively 
and 
biologically 
determined 
(Rhodes 
& 
Gelman, 
2009). 
Finally, 
though 
children 
demonstrate 
both 
native-
accent 
and 
own-race 
preferences 
when 
each 
category 
is 
tested 
separately 
(Aboud, 
1988; 
Kinzler 
et 
al., 
2007), 
when 
the 
two 
categories 
are 
put 
in 
conflict 
such 
that 
accent 
is 
pitted 
against 
race, 
children 
prefer 
native-accented 
other-
race 
individuals 
to 
foreign-accented 
own-race 
individuals 
(Kinzler, 
Shutts, 
DeJesus, 
& 
Spelke, 
2009). 
To 
tease 
apart 
the 
forces 
that 
drive 
children’s 
developing 
social 
preferences 
and 
potential 
priorities 
that 
emerge 
in 
children’s 
social 
categorization, 
it 
will 
be 
important 
to 
study 
the 
emergence 
of 
these 
preferences 
in 
younger 
infants. 


Do 
infants 
develop 
meaningful 
social 
preferences 
among 
novel 
individuals? 
If 
so, 
do 
these 
preferences 
depend 
on 
the 
relative 
familiarity 
of 
those 
individuals 
on 
any 
dimension, 
or 
do 
they 
depend 
on 
a 
more 
specific 
focus 
on 
particular 
kinds 
of 
categorical 
information? 
Recent 
research 
begins 
to 
address 
this 
question 
by 
focusing 
on 
infants’ 
social 
engagement 
with 
speakers 
of 
different 
languages 
and 
accents. 
In 
a 
series 
of 
studies, 
10-month-old 
infants 
in 
the 
US 
and 
France 
were 
shown 
movies 
of 
a 
native 
French 
speaker 
and 
a 
native 
English 
speaker 
who 
spoke 
to 
the 
infant 
in 
alternation. 
Infants 
then 
were 
shown 
events 
in 
which 
the 
two 
speakers 
appeared 
together 
without 
speaking, 
held 
up 
two 
identical 
toys 
and, 
silently 
and 
in 
synchrony, 
offered 
the 
toys 
to 
the 
infant. 
Just 
at 
the 
moment 
at 
which 
the 
toys 
disappeared 
from 
view, 
two 
real 
toys 
appeared 
in 
front 
of 
the 
infant, 
giving 
the 
illusion 
that 
the 
toys 
came 
from 
the 
screen. 
Infants 
in 
the 
US 
reached 
for 
the 
toy 
offered 
by 
an 
English 
speaker 
rather 
than 
a 
French 
speaker, 
and 
infants 
in 
France 
reached 
for 
the 
toy 
offered 
by 
the 
French 
speaker, 
even 
though 
the 
toys 
were 
identical 
and 
were 
never 
paired 
on 
screen 
with 
the 
language 
(Kinzler 
et 
al., 
2007). 
Prior 
to 
speaking 
themselves, 
therefore, 
infants 
chose 
to 
interact 
with 
a 
native 
speaker 
of 
their 
native 
language. 


Further 
research 
provides 
evidence 
that 
social 
preferences 
for 
native 
speakers 
persist 
in 
later 
childhood 
and 
guide 
even 
more 
explicit 
social 
decisions. 
In 
one 
study, 
2.5-year-old 
children 
were 
shown 
the 
same 
displays 
of 



K.D. 
Kinzler, 
E.S. 
Spelke 
/ 
Cognition 
119 
(2011) 
1–9 
French 
and 
English 
speakers. 
The 
two 
speakers 
then 
appeared 
together 
silently, 
and 
children 
were 
given 
an 
opportunity 
to 
‘‘give 
a 
present’’ 
to 
one 
of 
them. 
Children 
in 
both 
the 
US 
and 
France 
reliably 
chose 
the 
native 
speaker 
as 
the 
recipient 
of 
their 
gift 
(Kinzler, 
Dupoux, 
& 
Spelke, 
in 
press). 
In 
another 
study, 
5-year-old 
children 
viewed 
still 
photographs 
of 
children 
and 
listened 
to 
samples 
of 
their 
speech, 
which 
varied 
either 
in 
language 
or 
in 
accent. 
Children 
were 
asked 
to 
choose 
one 
child 
as 
a 
friend. 
Their 
choices 
were 
reliably 
affected 
by 
the 
accent 
with 
which 
the 
other 
children 
spoke. 
Moreover, 
children’s 
friendship 
choices 
dissociated 
from 
their 
judgments 
of 
comprehensibility: 
although 
children 
understood 
a 
child 
who 
spoke 
their 
native 
language 
with 
a 
foreign 
accent, 
they 
nonetheless 
preferred 
to 
associate 
with 
a 
native-accented 
child 
(Kinzler 
et 
al., 
2009). 


The 
above 
studies 
provide 
tools 
that 
can 
be 
used 
to 
probe 
the 
origins 
and 
nature 
of 
social 
categories, 
and 
find 
signatures 
of 
social 
preferences 
that 
go 
beyond 
measures 
of 
looking 
time 
in 
infancy. 
Beyond 
its 
potential 
evolutionary 
significance, 
language 
might 
be 
considered 
a 
particularly 
good 
candidate 
for 
eliciting 
social 
preferences 
early 
in 
development. 
From 
birth, 
infants 
prefer 
the 
sound 
of 
their 
native 
language 
to 
a 
foreign 
language, 
and 
discriminate 
two 
foreign 
languages 
if 
they 
cross 
a 
rhythmic 
boundary 
(Mehler 
et 
al., 
1988; 
Nazzi, 
Bertoncini, 
& 
Mehler, 
1998; 
Weikum 
et 
al., 
2007). 
By 
5 
months 
of 
age, 
infants 
successfully 
discriminate 
two 
languages 
or 
dialects 
within 
the 
same 
rhythmic 
class, 
provided 
that 
one 
of 
the 
languages 
is 
their 
own 
(Bosch 
& 
Sebastián-Gallés, 
1997; 
Nazzi, 
Jusczyk, 
& 
Johnson, 
2000). 
Beyond 
the 
literal 
communication 
it 
provides, 
spoken 
language 
also 
offers 
information 
about 
individuals’ 
nationality, 
regional 
membership, 
ethnic 
group, 
and 
social 
status 
or 
class 
(Gluszek 
& 
Dovidio, 
2010; 
Labov, 
2006). 
Indeed, 
adults 
use 
the 
language 
and 
accent 
of 
individuals 
that 
they 
have 
never 
met 
to 
infer 
not 
just 
the 
origins 
of 
those 
individuals, 
but 
also 
their 
intelligence, 
warmth, 
and 
even 
height 
(see 
Giles 
and 
Billings 
(2004) 
for 
a 
review). 


Language, 
however, 
is 
not 
alone 
in 
marking 
social 
groups 
in 
modern 
times. 
Language 
and 
race 
are 
similar 
in 
dividing 
the 
human 
social 
world 
into 
groups 
with 
high 
intra-group 
and 
low 
inter-group 
contact. 
Both 
categories 
elicit 
looking 
preferences 
for 
the 
familiar 
in 
infants 
(Bar-Haim 
et 
al., 
2006; 
Kelly 
et 
al., 
2005; 
Kinzler 
et 
al., 
2007), 
and 
within 
the 
first 
year 
of 
life 
infants 
evidence 
better 
face 
recognition 
of 
familiar 
compared 
to 
unfamiliar-
race 
faces 
(Kelly 
et 
al., 
2007; 
Sangrigoli 
& 
de 
Schonen, 
2004). 
By 
the 
end 
of 
the 
preschool 
years, 
children 
reliably 
express 
race-based 
social 
preferences 
and 
inferences 
(e.g., 
Aboud, 
1988; 
Baron 
& 
Banaji, 
2006; 
Cameron 
et 
al., 
2001). 
And, 
research 
from 
social 
psychology 
has 
provided 
manifest 
evidence 
of 
fast, 
automatic, 
and 
effortless 
encoding 
of 
race 
as 
part 
of 
person 
perception 
in 
adulthood, 
with 
myriad 
cognitive 
and 
social 
consequences 
(e.g., 
Dovidio, 
Kawakami, 
& 
Gaertner, 
2002; 
Hodson, 
Dovidio, 
& 
Gaertner, 
2002; 
Ito 
& 
Urland, 
2003; 
Macrae 
& 
Bodenhausen, 
2000; 
Meissner 
& 
Brigham, 
2001; 
Pettigrew 
& 
Meertens, 
1995). 
Thus, 
if 
the 
development 
of 
social 
preferences 
stems 
from 
differences 
observed 
in 
any 
dimension 
of 
social 
familiarity 
that 
infants 
can 
perceptually 
discriminate, 
or 
from 
social 


group 
distinctions 
that 
are 
marked 
in 
adulthood 
in 
modern 
times, 
then 
majority-race 
infants 
and 
young 
children 
should 
show 
social 
preferences 
based 
not 
only 
on 
language, 
but 
also 
on 
race. 
In 
contrast, 
if 
infants’ 
earliest 
social 
preferences 
rely 
in 
part 
on 
attention 
to 
factors 
that 
distinguished 
groups 
throughout 
evolutionary 
history, 
then 
infants 
may 
not 
award 
the 
same 
social 
importance 
to 
race 
as 
they 
do 
language. 


In 
the 
present 
research, 
we 
borrow 
methods 
previously 
used 
to 
test 
social 
preferences 
based 
on 
language, 
and 
employ 
them 
to 
test 
for 
early 
social 
preferences 
based 
on 
race. 
Three 
measures 
that 
previously 
revealed 
infants’ 
and 
children’s 
social 
preferences 
based 
on 
language 
were 
used 
to 
test 
the 
emergence 
of 
race-based 
social 
preferences 
throughout 
early 
childhood: 
toy 
choices 
at 
10 
months 
(Kinzler 
et 
al., 
2007), 
toy 
giving 
at 
2.5 
years 
(Kinzler 
et 
al., 
in 
press), 
and 
explicit 
judgments 
at 
5 
years 
(Kinzler 
et 
al., 
2009). 
In 
all 
three 
of 
the 
studies 
presented 
here, 
children 
were 
shown 
the 
same 
videotaped 
events 
involving 
one 
Black 
and 
one 
White 
female 
who 
smiled 
and, 
in 
some 
conditions, 
spoke 
with 
the 
child’s 
native 
language 
and 
accent. 


The 
present 
studies 
tested 
the 
race-based 
social 
preferences 
only 
of 
majority-race, 
White 
infants. 
We 
did 
not 
test 
minority-race 
infants, 
because 
the 
familiarity 
theory 
of 
social 
preferences 
makes 
no 
clear 
predictions 
concerning 
the 
preferences 
of 
such 
infants, 
for 
whom 
faces 
of 
both 
races 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
highly 
familiar 
(Bar-Haim 
et 
al., 
2006; 
see 
also 
Aboud 
& 
Skerry, 
1984). 
Moreover, 
although 
past 
research 
has 
shown 
preferences 
for 
native 
language 
speakers 
in 
infants 
for 
whom 
the 
native 
language 
is 
also 
the 
country’s 
predominant 
language 
(e.g. 
English 
in 
the 
US 
and 
French 
in 
France), 
we 
do 
not 
know 
if 
the 
same 
preferences 
would 
be 
shown 
by 
infants 
whose 
families 
speak 
a 
minority 
language. 
To 
maximize 
the 
similarity 
of 
the 
present 
tests 
of 
race 
preferences 
to 
previous 
tests 
of 
language 
preferences, 
therefore, 
we 
focused 
only 
on 
infants 
of 
the 
majority-race 
(White) 
in 
their 
communities. 


Experiment 
1 
presented 
White 
10-month-old 
infants 
with 
an 
interactive 
‘‘toy 
choice’’ 
in 
which 
toys 
were 
offered 
to 
infants 
by 
individuals 
who 
were 
either 
their 
own 
race 
(White), 
or 
another 
race 
(Black), 
and 
infants’ 
choices 
were 
measured. 
Experiment 
2 
used 
the 
same 
displays 
to 
test 
2.5-year-old 
children’s 
selective 
giving 
of 
toys 
to 
own-race 
vs. 
other-race 
individuals. 
Experiment 
3 
presented 
White 
5-year-old 
children 
with 
the 
same 
test 
displays 
as 
shown 
to 
infants 
and 
toddlers, 
and 
assessed 
children’s 
explicit 
social 
preferences 
towards 
own-and 
other-race 
individuals. 


2. 
Experiment 
1 
Experiment 
1 
borrowed 
the 
method 
of 
Kinzler 
et 
al. 
(2007), 
which 
tested 
infants’ 
early 
social 
preferences 
based 
on 
language, 
to 
assess 
infants’ 
preferences 
for 
social 
interactions 
based 
on 
race. 
White 
10-month-old 
infants 
were 
presented 
with 
videos 
of 
a 
White 
and 
a 
Black 
individual 
who 
each 
offered 
identical 
toy 
objects 
to 
the 
infant. 
An 
illusion 
was 
created 
such 
that 
the 
toys 
appeared 
to 
emerge 
from 
the 
screen, 
and 
landed 
on 
the 
table 
in 
front 
of 
the 
infant. 
Infants’ 
manual 
choices 
of 
objects 
were 
measured.

Because 
past 
research 
using 
this 
method 
revealed 
a 
strong 
effect 
of 
native 
language 
on 
infants’ 
toy 
choices, 
it 
was 
important 
to 
equate 
the 
speech 
of 
the 
two 
individuals. 
Nevertheless, 
a 
question 
arises 
as 
to 
whether 
to 
present 
the 
individuals 
in 
a 
speech 
context. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
presence 
of 
language 
in 
these 
videotapes 
would 
enhance 
any 
social 
effect 
of 
race, 
because 
the 
opportunity 
to 
hear 
both 
people 
speak 
might 
heighten 
infants’ 
attention 
to 
the 
people 
and 
their 
contrasting 
properties. 
Alternatively, 
given 
that 
speech 
may 
provide 
infants 
with 
evidence 
that 
each 
speaker 
is 
a 
member 
of 
their 
native 
community, 
social 
preferences 
between 
individuals 
of 
different 
races 
may 
be 
stronger 
when 
the 
individuals 
are 
silent 
and 
their 
language 
status 
is 
ambiguous. 
Accordingly, 
half 
of 
the 
infants 
in 
this 
experiment 
were 
tested 
with 
individuals 
who 
were 
silent 
(but 
friendly) 
throughout 
the 
study, 
and 
the 
remaining 
infants 
were 
tested 
with 
individuals 
who 
both 
spoke 
to 
infants 
in 
their 
native 
language. 


2.1. 
Method 
2.1.1. 
Participants 
Twenty-four 
full-term 
White 
10-month-old 
infants 
participated 
in 
the 
study 
(14 
females; 
mean 
age 
10 
months 
13 
days; 
range 
9 
months 
23 
days–11 
months 
2 
days). 
Data 
from 
1 
additional 
subject 
were 
excluded 
due 
to 
failure 
to 
make 
a 
choice 
on 
any 
trial. 


2.1.2. 
Materials 
The 
stimuli 
were 
modeled 
after 
those 
from 
Kinzler 
et 
al. 
(2007). 
The 
toy 
choice 
films 
depicted 
the 
two 
speakers 
(one 
White 
female, 
one 
Black 
female) 
simultaneously 
on 
screen, 
each 
holding 
an 
identical 
toy 
animal, 
smiling 
at 
the 
toy, 
and 
then 
smiling 
at 
the 
infant 
and 
lowering 
the 
toy 
as 
if 
offering 
it 
to 
the 
infant 
(19 
s; 
Fig. 
1). 
The 
White 
actress 
was 
featured 
in 
Kinzler 
et 
al. 
(2007). 
The 
Black 
actress 
was 
identified 
by 
adult 
raters 
to 
be 
clearly 
of 
African 
descent. 
The 
films 
were 
projected 
approximately 
life-size 
on 
a 
screen 
that 
measured 
92 
. 
122 
cm, 
behind 
a 
50 
cm 
table. 
The 
speaking 
trials 
consisted 
of 
each 
individual 
speaking 
to 
the 
baby 
in 
native 
child-directed 
speech 
for 
10 
s 
(in 
a 
13second 
total 
film). 


2.1.3. 
Design 
and 
procedure 
On 
each 
of 
four 
test 
trials, 
infants 
saw 
a 
toy 
choice 
event, 
with 
both 
White 
and 
Black 
individuals 
pictured 
simultaneously 
offering 
a 
toy 
to 
the 
infant. 
Just 
at 
the 
moment 
when 
the 
toys 
disappeared 
off 
screen, 
two 
real 
toys 
‘‘magically’’ 
appeared 
from 
behind 
the 
table 
for 
the 
infant 
to 
grasp, 
giving 
the 
illusion 
that 
they 
emerged 
from 
the 
screen. 
The 
objects 
were 
attached 
by 
Velcro 
to 
PVC 
piping 
that 
rotated 
from 
behind 
the 
table, 
and 
landed 
on 
the 
table 
equidistant 
from 
the 
infant 
and 
in 
front 
of 
the 
silent 
and 
motionless 
images 
of 
the 
two 
individuals. 
Half 
of 
participants 
saw 
only 
these 
four 
toy 
choice 
events; 
half 
of 
participants 
saw 
each 
toy 
offering 
event 
preceded 
by 
speaking 
trials, 
in 
which 
each 
individual 
engaged 
in 
infant-directed 
native 
speech. 
The 
ordering 
and 
lateral 
positions 
of 
the 
White 
and 
Black 
individuals 
were 
counterbalanced 
across 
infants 
in 
each 
condition, 
and 
the 
individuals 
reversed 
sides 
after 
the 
second 
trial. 
Infants’

These

individuals 
were 
featured 
in 
all 
three 
experiments. 


15-s 
period 
was 
recorded 
by 
an 
observer 
who 
was 
blind 
to 
the 
lateral 
position 
of 
individuals 
on 
each 
trial. 
Data 
for 
any 
infant 
who 
reached 
on 
at 
least 
one 
of 
the 
four 
trials, 
and 
watched 
the 
relevant 
offering 
event, 
were 
included. 
Data 
were 
analyzed 
by 
a 
repeated-measures 
ANOVA 
comparing 
number 
of 
choices 
of 
the 
toy 
offered 
by 
the 
White 
and 
Black 
individual. 


2.2. 
Results 
In 
both 
the 
speaking 
and 
the 
silent 
conditions, 
infants 
accepted 
toys 
about 
equally 
from 
the 
individuals 
of 
the 
two 
races; 
if 
anything, 
they 
showed 
a 
slight 
preference 
for 
the 
Black 
individual 
(Fig. 
2, 
left). 
A 
repeated-measures 
ANOVA 
comparing 
number 
of 
choices 
for 
the 
toy 
offered 
by 
the 
White 
individual 
vs. 
number 
of 
choices 
for 
the 
toy 
offered 
by 
the 
Black 
individual 
as 
a 
within-subjects 
variable, 
and 
condition 
(speaking 
or 
silent) 
as 
a 
between-
subject 
variable, 
revealed 
that 
infants 
had 
no 
significant 
preference 
to 
accept 
a 
toy 
from 
the 
White 
or 
Black 
individual 
(MWhite 
= 
1.29, 
SE 
= 
.22; 
MBlack 
= 
1.66; 
SE 
= 
.20, 
F(1,

= 
1.23, 
p

with 
no 
main 
effect 
of 
condition 
(F(1, 
23) 
=

p 
= 
n.s.), 
and 
no 
interaction 
of 
race 
with 
condition 
(F(1, 
22) 
= 
1.23, 
p 
= 
n.s.). 
A 
binomial 
non-parametric 
test 
confirmed 
this 
result: 
11 
children 
took 
more 
toys 
from 
the 
Black 
individuals, 
6 
children 
took 
more 
toys 
from 
the 
White 
individual, 
and 
7 
children 
took 
toys 
equally 
(p 
= 
n.s., 
2-tailed 
sign 
test). 


2.3. 
Discussion 
In 
contrast 
to 
infants’ 
preferences 
for 
interactions 
based 
on 
language 
(Kinzler 
et

preferentially 
accept 
toys 
from 
own-race 
individuals. 
Although 
young 
infants’ 
looking 
patterns 
in 
previous 
research 
provide 
evidence 
of 
attention 
to 
race 
(Bar-
Haim 
et 
al., 
2006; 
Kelly 
et 
al., 
2005), 
the 
present 
finding 
suggests 
that 
early 
looking 
patterns 
may 
not 
necessarily 
reflect 
deeper 
social 
predilections 
that 
are 
present 
prior 
to 
an 
infant’s 
first 
birthday. 
Looking 
preferences 
may 
evidence 
low-level 
visual 
preferences 
for 
familiar 
faces 
that 
are 
not 
consistent 
with 
social 
discriminations. 
Relative 
familiarity 
of 
any 
ilk, 
thus, 
may 
not 
equally 
compel 
early 
preferences 
for 
social 
interactions 
as 
measured 
on 
this 
task. 


It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
10 
months 
of 
age 
just 
precedes 
the 
time 
when 
infants 
are 
beginning 
to 
speak. 
Perhaps 
the 
nature 
of 
early 
language 
learning 
places 
a 
great 
emphasis 
on 
attention 
to 
native 
speakers, 
and 
slightly 
older, 
more 
linguistically 
sophisticated 
children 
would 
attend 
to 
both 
language 
and 
race 
in 
guiding 
their 
social 
preferences. 
Moreover, 
given 
that 
race-based 
social 
preferences 
are 
shown 
to 
emerge 
during 
the 
preschool 
years 
(e.g. 
Aboud, 
1988), 
it 
is 
plausible 
that 
such 
preferences 
might 
be 
found 
by 
the 
end 
of 
toddlerhood. 
Experiment 
2 
therefore 
tested 
2.5-year-old 
children’s 
social 
giving, 
which 
has 
been 
shown 
in 
past 
work 
to 
be 
an 
age-appropriate 
measure 
of 
social 
preferences 
in 
toddlers 
for 
native, 
compared 
to 
foreign 
speakers.

other-race 
individuals 
by 
means 
of 
a 
‘‘magical 
giving 
game,’’ 
(after 
Kinzler 
et 
al., 
in 
press). 
Children 
were 
given 
an 
object 
described 
as 
a 
‘‘present’’ 
and 
were 
shown 
that 
they 
could 
place 
it 
in 
a 
box 
to 
give 
to 
one 
of 
two 
cartoon 
characters, 
as 
training. 
When 
they 
did 
so, 
the 
toy 
subsequently 
appeared 
on 
screen 
in 
front 
of 
the 
character 
whose 
box 
the 
child 
had 
chosen. 
Once 
children 
understood 
the 
game, 
the 
characters 
were 
replaced 
by 
images 
from 
the 
videotapes 
used 
in 
Experiment 
1, 
depicting 
two 
women 
of 
differing 
race. 
Children’s 
choices 
of 
giving 
to 
either 
the 
White 
or 
Black 
individual 
were 
recorded. 


3.1. 
Methods 
3.1.1. 
Participants 
Twenty-four 
full-term 
2.5–3-year-old 
White 
children 
participated 
in 
the 
study 
(12 
females; 
mean 
age 


32.5 
months; 
range 
29.5–35.5 
months). 
3.1.2. 
Materials 
The 
same 
Black 
and 
White 
individuals 
featured 
in 
Experiment 
1 
served 
as 
stimuli. 
Static 
images 
of 
the 
two 
individuals 
were 
projected 
approximately 
life-size 
on 
screen, 
with 
the 
child 
seated 
at 
the 
table 
in 
front 
of 
the 
screen. 
A 
table 
was 
positioned 
50 
cm 
from 
the 
screen, 
to 
allow 
for 
an 
experimenter 
to 
move 
between 
the 
screen 
and 
the 
table. 
On 
the 
table 
were 
two 
cardboard 
boxes 
(20 
cm3) 
with 
a 
felt 
opening 
on 
top, 
and 
a 
felt 
opening 
on 
the 
side 
towards 
the 
screen, 
such 
that 
a 
child 
could 
place 
something 
in 
the 
box 
on 
the 
top 
side, 
and 
an 
experimenter 
could 
remove 
the 
item 
from 
the 
back 
of 
the 
box. 
Boxes 
were 
placed 
on 
the 
left 
and 
right 
side 
of 
the 
table, 
equidistant 
from 
the 
child. 


3.1.3. 
Procedure 
Children 
were 
first 
instructed 
in 
the 
giving 
game. 
An 
experimenter 
sat 
facing 
the 
child, 
between 
the 
screen 
and 
the 
table. 
A 
series 
of 
pairs 
of 
cartoon 
animals 
appeared 
on 
the 
left 
and 
right 
side 
of 
the 
screen, 
and 
children 
were 
shown 
that 
when 
a 
‘‘present’’ 
(different 
colored 
toy 
balls) 
was 
placed 
in 
one 
of 
the 
two 
boxes, 
the 
present 
would 
subsequently 
appear 
on 
screen, 
and 
reward 
the 
animal 
on 
the 
corresponding 
side 
of 
the 
screen. 
During 
two 
test 
trials, 
children 
were 
shown 
an 
image 
of 
the 
two 
individuals 
side-by-side 
on 
screen, 
at 
which 
point 
children 
were 
instructed 
to 
‘‘give 
a 
present’’ 
to 
one 
of 
the 
two 
individuals. 
When 
the 
child 
placed 
the 
present 
in 
one 
of 
the 
two 
boxes, 
a 
chime 
noise 
was 
played, 
the 
present 
appeared 
on 
the 
screen, 
and 
the 
individual 
on 
the 
corresponding 
side 
of 
the 
screen 
smiled. 
Lateral 
position 
of 
presentation 
(White 
individual 
on 
the 
left 
or 
right) 
was 
counterbalanced 
across 
children.

Results 
and 
discussion 
Children 
gave 
presents 
equally 
to 
the 
two 
individuals 
who 
differed 
in 
racial 
group 
membership 
(MWhite 
= 
1.00, 
SE 
= 
.12; 
MBlack 
= 
.96, 
SE 
= 
.11; 
Fig. 
2, 
center). 
A 
nonparametric 
test 
confirmed 
that 
children 
did 
not 
selectively 
give 
to 
one 
individual 
over 
the 
other: 
four 
children 
gave 
more 
to 
the 
White 
individual, 
four 
children 
gave 
more 
to 
the 
Black 
individual, 
and 
16 
children 
gave 
equally 
(p 
= 
n.s., 
2-tailed 
sign 
test). 
To 
test 
whether 
children’s 
performance 
reflected 
a 
strategy 
of 
equal 
giving 
across 
the 
two 
trials, 
a 
further 
analysis 
focused 
on 
just 
the 
first 
trial, 
when 
children 
had 
no 
way 
to 
know 
whether 
a 
second 
trial 
would 
be 
offered. 
On 
the 
first 
trial, 
11 
children 
chose 
to 
give 
the 
present 
to 
the 
White 
individual, 
12 
children 
chose 
the 
Black 
individual, 
and 
one 
child 
did 
not 
make 
a 
choice. 
Again, 
their 
patterns 
of 
response 
on 
the 
first 
trial 
did 
not 
differ 
from 
chance 
(p 
= 
n.s., 
2-tailed 
sign 
test). 
Thus, 
the 
absence 
of 
race-based 
giving 
preferences 
cannot 
be 
explained 
as 
a 
strategy 
of 
egalitarian 
giving. 
The 
findings 
suggest, 
instead, 
that 
2.5-year-old 
children’s 
giving 
is 
influenced 
by 
the 
language 
of 
their 
potential 
recipients 
but 
not 
by 
the 
recipients’ 
race. 


Although 
past 
research 
demonstrates 
clear 
evidence 
of 
majority-race 
preschool-aged 
children’s 
social 
preferences 
based 
on 
race, 
most 
findings 
are 
reported 
beginning 
at 
age 
4 
or 
5, 
and 
do 
not 
necessarily 
find 
similarly 
strong 
results 
with 
3-year-old 
children 
(Abel 
& 
Sahinkaya, 
1962; 
Aboud, 
2003; 
Brown 
& 
Johnson, 
1971; 
Kircher 
& 
Furby, 
1971; 
Stevenson 
& 
Stewart, 
1958). 
Recent 
research 
investigating 
3-year-old 
children’s 
attention 
to 
social 
categories 
in 
guiding 
their 
object-based 
preferences 
finds 
that 
children 
of 
this 
age 
only 
marginally 
attend 
to 
race, 
in 
contrast 
to 
robust 
attention 
to 
gender 
and 
age 
(Shutts 
et 
al., 
2010). 
Thus, 
a 
failure 
to 
find 
race-based 
social 
preferences 
at 


2.5 
years 
is 
not 
inconsistent 
with 
previous 
research, 
and 
provides 
further 
evidence 
that 
race-based 
social 
preferences 
may 
emerge 
only 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
preschool 
years. 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
children 
tested 
in 
this 
sample, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
Experiment 
1, 
were 
exclusively 
White. 
Though 
testing 
a 
more 
diverse 
group 
of 
children 
would 
certainly 
be 
desirable, 
if 
one 
were 
to 
expect 
to 
find 
early 
race-based 
preferences, 
they 
would 
most 
likely 
be 
found 
in 
White 
majority-race 
children 
(Aboud 
& 
Skerry, 
1984). 
The 
final 
experiment 
therefore 
tested 
for 
race-based 
social 
preferences 
in 
older 
White 
children, 
using 
the 
same 
stimuli 
presented 
to 
infants 
and 
toddlers 
in 
the 
first 
2 
experiments. 


4. 
Experiment 
3 
Experiment 
3 
investigated 
5–6 
year-old 
children’s 
explicit 
social 
preferences 
for 
novel 
individuals 
who 
are 
Black 
vs. 
White, 
using 
two 
measures. 
Children 
were 
shown 
the 
displays 
presented 
to 
infants 
and 
younger 
children 
in 
Experiments 
1 
and 
2. 
Children 
were 
told 
that 
these 
displays 
were 
shown 
to 
infants, 
and 
they 
were 
asked 
which 
person 
they 
thought 
that 
infants 
would 
prefer, 
and 
also 
which 
person 
they 
would 
prefer 
to 
have 
as 
a 
friend, 
following 
the 
method 
of 
Kinzler 
et 
al. 
(2009). 
Consistent 
with 
past 
research, 
we 
predicted 
that 
children 
would 
select 
the 
White 
individual. 


4.1. 
Participants 
Twelve 
White 
5–6-year-old 
children 
(mean: 
5 
years 
9 
months; 
range: 
5 
years, 
2 
months 
to 
7 
years 
0 
years) 
participated 
in 
the 
experiment. 


4.2. 
Materials 
Images 
from 
dependent 
measures 
in 
Experiments 
1 
(toy 
offering 
events) 
and 
2 
(static 
images 
of 
each 
individual) 
served 
as 
stimuli. 


4.3. 
Design 
and 
procedure 
Children 
were 
shown 
two 
events. 
During 
the 
toy 
offering 
event, 
children 
were 
shown 
a 
movie 
of 
the 
White 
and 
Black 
individual 
smiling, 
and 
offering 
two 
toys. 
Children 
were 
asked, 
‘‘These 
are 
movies 
we 
show 
to 
babies. 
Whom 
do 
you 
think 
babies 
will 
choose 
to 
take 
toys 
from?’’ 
During 
the 
static 
event, 
children 
were 
shown 
the 
Black 
and 
White 
individual 
on 
screen, 
and 
were 
asked 
‘‘Which 
one 
would 
you 
rather 
be 
friends 
with?’’ 
The 
order 
of 
the 
offering 
and 
static 
trials, 
the 
order 
of 
individuals 
presented 
within 
each 
trial, 
and 
the 
left–right 
positions 
of 
the 
two 
individuals 
presented 
on 
the 
screen 
were 
orthogonally 
counterbalanced 
across 
children. 
Children’s 
choices 
were 
tested 
against 
chance 
(.5) 
by 
binomial 
tests. 


4.4. 
Results 
and 
discussion 
Across 
the 
two 
test 
questions, 
children 
robustly 
chose 
the 
White 
individual 
(MWhite 
= 
1.75 
choices, 
SE 
= 
.13; 
MBlack 
= 
.25 
choices, 
SE 
= 
.13). 
See 
Fig. 
2, 
right. 
When 
shown 
the 
toy 
offering 
event, 
11/12 
children 
chose 
the 
White 
individual 
(p 
< 
.01, 
2-tailed 
sign 
test). 
When 
shown 
the 
static 
images 
and 
asked 
whom 
they 
preferred 
as 
friends, 
10/12 
children 
chose 
the 
White 
individual 
(p 
< 
.05, 
2-tailed 
sign 
test). 
Thus, 
consistent 
with 
past 
research, 
kindergarten-
aged 
children 
demonstrated 
race-based 
social 
preferences. 
Moreover, 
children’s 
choices 
for 
the 
own-race 
individual 
provide 
evidence 
that 
the 
race 
of 
the 
particular 
individuals 
used 
in 
these 
studies 
was 
apparent, 
and 
infants’ 
and 
children’s 
failure 
to 
demonstrate 
race-based 
social 
preferences 
in 
Experiments 
1 
and 
2 
was 
not 
due 
to 
an 
unbalanced 
choice 
of 
stimuli. 


5. 
General 
discussion 
Across 
three 
experiments, 
a 
developmental 
progression 
in 
infants’ 
and 
children’s 
race-based 
social 
preferences 
was 
observed. 
In 
Experiment 
1, 
White 
10-month-old 
infants 
accepted 
toys 
equally 
from 
White 
and 
Black 
individuals. 
In 
Experiment 
2, 
White 
2.5-year-old 
children 
gave 
toys 
equally 
to 
White 
and 
Black 
individuals. 
In 
contrast, 
when 
White 
5–6-year-old 
children 
viewed 
the 
same 
events, 
they 
expressed 
race-based 
social 
preferences. 
These 
findings 
cast 
doubt 
on 
the 
thesis 
that 
the 
same-race 
looking 
preferences 
of 
younger, 
majority-race 
infants 
are 
true 
social 
preferences. 
Rather, 
they 
suggest 
that 
social 
preferences 
based 
on 
race 
emerge 
between 
2.5 
and 
5 
years 
of 
age.

(2011) 
1–9 
Several 
alternative 
interpretations 
for 
the 
present 
findings 
can 
be 
rejected, 
based 
on 
the 
findings 
themselves 
and 
on 
past 
research. 
First, 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
the 
absence 
of 
race-based 
preferences 
at 
the 
two 
younger 
ages 
reflects 
an 
egalitarian 
bias 
leading 
children 
to 
choose 
the 
two 
people 
equally 
across 
trials, 
masking 
an 
existing 
race-based 
preference. 
Although 
egalitarian 
responding 
is 
sometimes 
observed 
in 
children, 
it 
tends 
to 
increase, 
not 
decrease, 
with 
age 
(Fehr 
et 
al., 
2008). 
Moreover, 
children 
showed 
no 
egalitarian 
bias 
towards 
giving 
resources 
to 
individuals 
who 
differ 
in 
their 
native 
language 
(Kinzler 
et 
al., 
2007, 
in 
press). 
Finally, 
in 
Experiment 
2, 
children 
showed 
no 
preference 
overall 
for 
the 
own-race 
individual, 
and 
no 
preference 
on 
the 
first 
of 
two 
giving 
trials. 
All 
these 
findings 
cast 
doubt 
on 
the 
idea 
that 
infants 
and 
children 
have 
an 
own-
race 
preference 
that 
is 
tempered 
by 
a 
tendency 
toward 
egalitarian 
social 
behavior. 


Second, 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
infants’ 
and 
young 
children’s 
equal 
patterns 
of 
receiving 
and 
giving 
reflect 
a 
failure 
to 
detect 
the 
individuals’ 
race. 
Children’s 
choices 
for 
the 
own-race 
individual 
in 
Experiment 
3 
provide 
evidence 
that 
the 
race 
of 
the 
particular 
individuals 
used 
in 
these 
studies 
was 
apparent 
to 
older 
children. 
Moreover, 
race 
detection 
is 
highly 
reliable 
and 
replicable 
in 
even 
younger 
infants 
than 
those 
tested 
here 
(Bar-Haim 
et 
al., 
2006; 
Kelly 
et 
al., 
2005). 
Indeed, 
3-month-old 
infants 
respond 
to 
race 
in 
faces 
that 
are 
presented 
under 
far 
more 
impoverished 
conditions, 
when 
each 
face 
is 
presented 
only 
in 
a 
single 
static 
photograph. 
Although 
abilities 
to 
discriminate 
and 
categorize 
faces 
likely 
increase 
substantially 
over 
infancy 
and 
childhood 
– 
as 
suggested 
by 
an 
increase 
over 
the 
first 
year 
of 
life 
in 
infants’ 
relative 
recognition 
memory 
for 
familiar-race, 
over 
unfamiliar-race 
faces 
(Kelly 
et 
al., 
2007) 
– 
the 
present 
findings 
are 
not 
likely 
due 
to 
a 
simple 
failure 
of 
perceptual 
discrimination. 


Third, 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
infants’ 
and 
young 
children’s 
equal 
patterns 
of 
receiving 
and 
giving 
reflect 
limitations 
of 
the 
methods 
used 
to 
test 
for 
race-based 
social 
preferences. 
Experiments 
1 
and 
2 
tested 
for 
these 
preferences 
using 
the 
same 
methods 
that 
provided 
evidence 
for 
social 
preferences 
based 
on 
language 
in 
infants 
and 
children 
of 
the 
same 
age 
as 
those 
in 
the 
present 
studies 
(Kinzler 
et 
al., 
2007, 
in 
press). 
Of 
course, 
it 
is 
always 
possible 
that 
infants 
and 
young 
children 
have 
some 
incipient 
social 
preferences 
among 
people 
of 
different 
races 
that 
the 
present 
displays 
and 
methods 
failed 
to 
reveal. 
If 
such 
preferences 
exist, 
however, 
they 
are 
fragile 
in 
comparison 
to 
infants’ 
preferences 
among 
speakers 
of 
different 
languages. 


The 
contrasting 
effects 
of 
language 
and 
race 
on 
infants’ 
social 
preferences 
are 
of 
theoretical 
importance, 
for 
they 
suggest 
that 
these 
two 
dimensions 
of 
familiarity 
are 
not 
equal 
to 
infants. 
Although 
young 
infants 
look 
longer 
at 
both 
individuals 
who 
previously 
spoke 
in 
a 
native 
language 
with 
a 
native 
accent 
(Kinzler 
et 
al., 
2007), 
and 
individuals 
who 
are 
of 
a 
familiar 
race 
(Bar-Haim 
et 
al., 
2006; 
Kelly 
et 
al., 
2005), 
early 
looking 
preferences 
based 
on 
language 
and 
race 
may 
reflect 
two 
different 
phenomena. 
The 
former 
may 
be 
a 
sign 
of 
a 
social 
preference 
for 
individuals 
in 
one’s 
native 
language 
group. 
In 
contrast, 
the 
latter 
may 
be 
a 
sign 
of 
visual 
familiarity, 
allowing 
for 
more 
efficient 
or 
deeper 
perceptual 
processing 
of 
a 
face 
with 
little 
or 
no 


consequence 
for 
early 
social 
interactions. 
It 
would 
be 
interesting 
to 
further 
explore 
potential 
relationships 
and 
discontinuities 
between 
infants’ 
and 
children’s 
face 
processing 
and 
social 
preferences. 


Although 
5–6 
year-old 
children 
showed 
preferences 
based 
on 
race 
in 
Experiment 
3, 
other 
research 
has 
compared 
race 
and 
language 
preferences 
directly 
at 
this 
age, 
providing 
evidence 
that 
accent 
trumps 
race 
in 
children’s 
explicit 
social 
judgments 
(Kinzler 
et 
al., 
2009). 
Though 
by 
5 
years 
of 
age 
children 
profess 
explicit 
preferences 
for 
both 
native-accented 
individuals 
and 
own-race 
individuals 
in 
isolation, 
when 
accent 
is 
pitted 
against 
race, 
White 
children 
prefer 
to 
be 
friends 
with 
someone 
who 
is 
Black 
and 
speaks 
in 
a 
native 
accent, 
rather 
than 
someone 
who 
is 
White 
and 
speaks 
with 
a 
foreign 
accent 
(Kinzler 
et 
al., 
2009). 
Throughout 
the 
preschool 
years, 
therefore, 
language 
provides 
a 
more 
powerful 
basis 
for 
social 
categorization 
and 
preference 
than 
does 
race. 


There 
are 
several 
reasons 
why 
language 
may 
trump 
race 
in 
its 
early 
social 
salience. 
First, 
children 
have 
a 
‘‘head 
start’’ 
in 
their 
familiarization 
to 
language 
over 
race. 
From 
birth, 
infants 
prefer 
the 
sound 
of 
their 
native 
language 
due 
to 
input 
they 
received 
in 
the 
womb 
(Mehler 
et 
al., 
1988; 
Moon, 
Cooper, 
& 
Fifer, 
1993), 
whereas 
it 
is 
not 
until 
3 
months 
of 
age 
that 
infants 
prefer 
own-race 
faces 
(Kelly 
et 
al., 
2005). 
Furthermore, 
as 
discussed 
above, 
there 
is 
reason 
to 
think 
that 
the 
language 
with 
which 
people 
speak 
may 
have 
carried 
greater 
weight 
in 
denoting 
group 
membership 
throughout 
our 
evolutionary 
history 
than 
did 
skin 
color. 
Though 
neighboring 
groups 
in 
ancient 
times 
likely 
spoke 
with 
different 
accents 
and 
dialects, 
they 
likely 
didn’t 
look 
very 
different 
in 
terms 
of 
their 
race 
(Baker, 
2001; 
Kurzban 
et 
al., 
2001). 
Thus, 
cognitive 
evolution 
may 
have 
favored 
attention 
to 
language 
or 
dialect 
as 
a 
valid 
marker 
of 
coalitional 
group 
membership 
(Henrich 
& 
Henrich, 
2007; 
McElreath 
et 
al., 
2003), 
and 
this 
predisposition 
may 
be 
reflected 
in 
modern-day 
infants’ 
early 
social 
preferences. 


Finally, 
and 
perhaps 
most 
speculatively, 
attention 
to 
language 
over 
race 
may 
reflect 
an 
‘‘essentialist 
bias,’’ 
in 
which 
language 
is 
treated 
by 
children 
as 
an 
‘‘inner’’ 
property, 
whereas 
race 
is 
treated 
as 
a 
less 
important 
‘‘outer’’ 
property 
of 
individuals. 
This 
hypothesis 
accords 
with 
research 
showing 
that 
children’s 
attention 
to 
categorical 
information 
can 
outweigh 
attention 
to 
perceptual 
information 
when 
reasoning 
about 
other 
social 
categories 
such 
as 
gender 
and 
ethnicity 
(Gelman, 
Collman, 
& 
Maccoby, 
1986; 
Diesendruck 
& 
haLevi, 
2006), 
and 
that 
even 
in 
infancy, 
children 
see 
internal 
features 
of 
an 
individual 
as 
being 
more 
predictive 
of 
his 
behaviors 
than 
external 
properties 
(Newman, 
Herrmann, 
Wynn, 
& 
Keil, 
2008). 
These 
explanations 
are 
not 
inconsistent 
with 
one 
another, 
and 
may 
in 
fact 
work 
together 
to 
explain 
the 
phenomena 
at 
hand. 
In 
particular, 
an 
essentialist 
bias 
may 
be 
a 
proximate 
mechanism 
that 
mediates 
the 
ultimate 
adaptive 
mechanism 
for 
monitoring 
meaningful 
social 
groups. 


The 
present 
research 
raises 
questions 
about 
the 
potential 
malleability 
of 
early 
social 
biases. 
Infants 
and 
toddlers 
in 
Experiments 
1 
and 
2 
do 
not 
attend 
to 
race 
in 
guiding 
their 
early 
interactions, 
but 
5-year-old 
children 
shown 
the 
same 
stimuli 
prefer 
individuals 
of 
their 
own 
race

almost 
unanimously. 
The 
finding 
that 
race-based 
preferences 
emerge 
over 
childhood 
suggests 
that 
they 
may 
not 
be 
mandatory, 
but 
rather 
may 
emerge 
as 
a 
result 
of 
exposure 
to 
racially 
stratified 
societies 
in 
which 
race 
is 
often 
a 
marker 
of 
group 
membership. 
Children 
may 
be 
inclined 
to 
group 
the 
world 
into 
human 
kinds 
(Hirschfeld, 
1996), 
or 
ingroups 
and 
outgroups 
(Dunham, 
Baron, 
& 
Banaji, 
2008); 
nonetheless, 
children 
may 
not 
view 
race 
as 
a 
mandatory 
variable 
by 
which 
groups 
are 
determined 
in 
all 
environments. 
Future 
research 
therefore 
should 
investigate 
the 
potential 
malleability 
of 
early 
social 
preferences 
as 
a 
result 
of 
exposure 
to 
diverse 
environments. 
The 
present 
research 
provides 
a 
note 
of 
optimism 
that 
later 
race-based 
social 
preferences 
may 
not 
be 
a 
predetermined 
outcome 
of 
any 
and 
all 
social 
worlds.
