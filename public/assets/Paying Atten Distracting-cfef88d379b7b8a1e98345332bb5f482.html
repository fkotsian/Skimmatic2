>Two experiments examined the impact of attention on sensorimotor skills. In Experiment 1, experienced golfers putted under dual-task conditions designed to distract attention from putting and under skill-focused conditions that prompted attention to step-by-step putting performance. Dual-task condition putting was more accurate. In Experiment 2, right-footed novice and experienced soccer players dribbled through a slalom course under dual-task or skill-focused conditions. When using their dominant right foot, experts again performed better in the dual-task condition. However, when using their less proficient left foot, experts performed better in the skill-focused condition. Novices performed better under skill-focus regardless of foot. Whereas novices and the less-proficient performances of experts benefit from online attentional monitoring of step-by-step performance, high-level skill execution is harmed. </SPAN

>What drives the performance of a well-learned skill? Knowledge structures (Chi, Feltovich, & Glaser, 1981), memory capacities (Chase & Simon, 1973; de Groot, 1978; Starkes & Deakin, 1984), problem-solving abilities (Priest & Lindsay, 1992; Tenenbaum & Bar-Eli, 1993), and individual differences (Ackerman, 1987; Ackerman & Cianciolo, 2000; R. Kanfer & Ackerman, 1989) involved in high-level performance have been extensively examined, as well as compared across skill levels, in an attempt to shed light on the variables mediating exceptional task execution. Although work in this area has produced a number of important findings in both cognitive and sensorimotor skill domains (see Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996), there remain aspects of high-level performance that have not yet received adequate analysis. </SPAN

>One such area centers around the attentional mechanisms supporting skill execution in real time. That is, the manner in which experienced performers allocate attention to skill processes and procedures as actual skill execution unfolds, as well as differences in the attentional requirements of low-and high-level performances, are not yet fully understood. The purpose of the present study was twofold: (a) to assess the attentional mechanisms supporting performance of two sensorimotor skills in real time and (b) to explore the relationship between the attentional demands of online skill execution and degree of task proficiency. This knowledge will not only aid in developing the most appropriate techniques for optimal skill acquisition (Singer, Lidor, & Cauraugh, </SPAN

>Skill acquisition is believed to progress through distinct phases characterized by both qualitative differences in the cognitive structures supporting performance and differences in performance itself. Researchers have proposed that early in learning, skill execution is supported by a set of unintegrated control structures that are held in working memory and attended to one-by-one in a step-by-step fashion (Anderson, 1983, 1993; Fitts & Posner, 1967; Proctor & Dutta, 1995). As a result, attention is committed to controlling task performance and hence is largely unavailable for the interpretation or processing of nontask-related stimuli. With practice, however, procedural knowledge specific to the task at hand develops. Procedural knowledge does not require constant control and operates largely outside of working memory (Anderson, 1993; Fitts & Posner, 1967; Keele & Summers, 1976; Kimble & Perlmuter, 1970; Langer & Imber, 1979). Thus, in contrast to earlier stages of performance, once a skill becomes relatively well learned, attention may not be needed for the step-by-step control of execution and may be available for the processing of extraneous stimuli. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F"
>The impact of secondary task demands on novel skill acquisition and performance, as well as the ability of high-level performers to successfully operate in environments with substantial attentional load, have been widely demonstrated. Nissen and Bullemer (1987) examined individuals’ performance on a novel sequence-learning task under both single-task and dual-task conditions. The sequence task was a four-choice reaction time task in which stimuli were </SPAN

>presented in a consistent pattern in one of four locations on a computer screen. Participants were instructed to respond to the presentation of each stimulus by pressing a key at a corresponding spatial location. In the single-task condition, individuals practiced the sequence in isolation. In the dual-task condition, participants practiced the sequence while performing an attention-demanding, secondary auditory-monitoring task. In contrast to the single-task sequence condition, individuals performing under added secondary task demands showed no evidence of sequence learning during performance in the dual-task situation or during a transfer test in which individuals received the same sequence in isolation. Subsequent work by A. Cohen, Ivry, and Keele (1990) showed that the severity of the dual-task decrement in sequence learning varied with the complexity of the sequential pattern. These findings suggest that at the initial stages of performance, attention may be a necessary ingredient of skill learning, and the more so the more complicated the skill. </SPAN

>Although attention to task components may be important for novel skill execution and learning, this may not be the case at higher levels of practice. Allport, Antonis, and Reynolds (1972) found support for this notion through the examination of skilled pianists</SPAN

><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F"
>ability to sight-read music while performing a secondary auditory-monitoring task. When skilled pianists were asked to sight-read in addition to shadowing a series of auditorially presented words, their sight-reading performance was not significantly altered in comparison with sight-reading in isolation. All-port et al. suggested that well-learned sight-reading does not demand constant attentional control. As a result, attention is available to devote to secondary task demands without significantly disrupting primary task performance. </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F"
>Fisk and Schneider (1984) have also argued that well-learned performances are not based on explicit attentional control mechanisms. Individuals were trained on a visual search task in which they learned to search through arrays of visually presented words for members of a target category. With practice, both reaction time and accuracy in finding targets increased, whereas recognition memory for the words that had been searched through declined in comparison with memory at lower levels of practice. Fisk and Schneider suggested that practice automated performance, and automating performance improved real-time skill execution while decreasing attention to specific task components. </SPAN

>Thus, novel and well-learned performances appear to require different levels of attentional resources for successful execution. This experience by attentional demand interaction has also been demonstrated in complex sensorimotor skills drawn from the real world. For example, Leavitt (1979) examined novice and experienced ice hockey players</SPAN

>The results of Leavitt (1979) and Smith and Chamberlin (1992) support the notion that well-learned skill performance does not require constant online attentional control. However, it should be noted that these findings are potentially confounded. The secondary tasks used in the hockey and soccer tasks were both in the visual modality. Low-skill players often spend a considerable amount of time looking down at the puck or the ball while performing these skills. Thus, skill level differences in these studies may not have been due to experts</SPAN

>(Kahneman, 1973; Wickens, 1980, 1984), rather than differential demands of novice and experienced skill performance on attention, may have led to the above mentioned findings. For novices, both the primary task of stick handling or dribbling and the secondary visual-monitoring task require visual input, and the information-gathering structures of the visual system cannot be directed toward both the primary and secondary tasks</SPAN

>Recently, Beilock, Wierenga, and Carr (in press a, b) addressed this confound in the exploration of the attentional mechanisms governing novice and well-learned golf putting. Novice and experienced golfers took a series of golf putts in a single-task putting condition (involving putting in a quiet, isolated environment) and in a dual-task condition. In the dual-task condition, individuals putted while monitoring verbally presented words for a specified target word. Because auditory capacity should not differ as a function of golf-putting experience, and auditory input should not create structural interference with the visual input of putting, this secondary task was designed to be free of the confound present in Leavitt (1979) and Smith and Chamberlin</SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F"

><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F"

Furthermore, when experienced golfers were given an unexpected recognition memory test for a subset of the words contained in the monitoring task, their performance did not differ from a single-task word recognition test given as a baseline measure. Because attention is known to influence recognition memory (Craik, Govini, Naveh-Benjamin, & Anderson, 1996), this result indicates that experienced golfers were able to pay just as much attention to the words while putting as when attending to the words was their only task, and that doing so did not harm their putting performance. In contrast, novice </SPAN

Specifically, high-level skill execution is thought to be governed by proceduralized knowledge that does not require explicit monitoring and control. Thus, a dual-task environment should not degrade performance in comparison with skill execution under single-task conditions, as attention should be available to allocate to secondary task demands if necessary without detracting from control of the primary skill. The above results demonstrate precisely this notion. It should be noted, however, that these findings may not hold true for dual-task environments in which the tasks draw on similar processes and hence create structural interference (e.g., looking at a golf ball while lining up a putt and visually monitoring a screen for a target object). </SPAN

The fact that individuals with poorer putting accuracy were also less able to identify target tones suggests that putting performance under dual-task conditions was not the result of a simple trade-off between primary putting and secondary tone-monitoring performance. It should be noted that there may be individual differences in performance ability such that certain individuals are less accurate at both putting and secondary task target tone detection. Therefore, the possibility of a more complex trade-off cannot be completely ruled out. However, the positive correlation between putting accuracy error scores and tone detection error rates does suggest that even though average performance was at least as good in the dual-task condition as in the single-task practice condition, there remained a degree of variation in how much attention experienced golfers paid to their putting, which could be detected in accuracy of tone detection. The less accurate the putting was, the greater the amount of attention was paid to it as indexed by decreased accuracy of tone detection. </SPAN

>The results of Experiment 1 demonstrate that well-learned golf putting does not require constant online control. As a result, attention is available for the processing of secondary task information if necessary (such as monitoring a series of auditory tones). However, when prompted to attend to a specific component of the golf swing, experienced performance degrades in comparison with both single-task practice performance and dual-task conditions. Although the negligible effects of divided attention on well-learned performance have been previously demonstrated (Beilock et al., in press a; b; Leavitt, 1979; Smith & Chamberlin, 1992), the consequences of explicitly attending to automated or proceduralized performance processes have not received so much investigation. The present findings suggest that well-learned performance may actually be compromised by attending to skill execution. This result complements recent evidence on </SPAN

>differing levels of skill proficiency. Experiment 1 demonstrated that it can be disadvantageous to explicitly attend to a specific component of an automated or proceduralized well-learned skill performance. However, by analogy to ballistic versus nonballistic movements (Banich, 1997), it might be that explicit attention plays a different role in continuous tasks extended in time, such as soccer dribbling, than in the discrete golf-putting task with a defined beginning and ending point just reported. Furthermore, in addition to task differences, there also may be expertise differences in the impact of attention. Researchers have suggested that close attentional monitoring and attentional control benefits novice performers in the initial stages of task learning (Anderson, 1983; Fitts & Posner, 1967). This notion has received both empirical and anecdotal support (see Curran & Keele, 1993; Proctor & Dutta, 1995). Recently, however, the benefits of attention to specific task components in novel sensorimotor skill performance have been challenged (Singer et al., 1993; Wulf et al., 1998, 2000). Instead, researchers have suggested that instructing novices to attend to task properties during online motor skill performance may actually hinder skill acquisition. Wulf et al. (1998) examined the effects of both an internal focus of attention (defined as attention to specific body movements, much like our skill-focused condition) and an external focus of attention (defined as attention to the effects or outcomes of body movements) on the learning and retention of a ski simulator and stabilometer task. Results demonstrated that an external focus of attention led to more effective learning than an internal focus. Wulf and colleagues proposed that explicitly attending to skill execution at the initial stages of skill learning may actually hinder performance. Thus, a controversy remains over the types of attentional mechanisms thought to support less experienced or less practiced performance processes. </SPAN

Individuals were also informed that prior to each dribbling attempt, the experimenter would instruct them as to which foot to use. Finally, participants were told that each dribbling trial would be timed by the experimenter. If an error in dribbling performance occurred or the proper foot was not used, the dribbling trial was repeated. This was done to ensure that participants completed the entire slalom course with the specified foot. Because we were interested in making specific predictions concerning the dribbling performance of each foot under the various attentional manipulations, it was extremely important to ensure that participants were solely using the correct foot for each attention condition. Thus, trials containing dribbling errors were repeated.

>The purpose of Experiment 2 was to explore differences in the attentional mechanisms supporting online sensorimotor skill execution in novice and experienced soccer players, as well as to assess differences in the attentional requirements of dominant and nondominant foot performance within level of expertise. Theories of skill acquisition have proposed that distinct cognitive processes are involved at different stages of skill execution. Early in learning, individuals are thought to attend to the step-by-step processes of performance. However, once a high level of performance has been achieved, constant online attentional control may not be necessary (Anderson, 1983, 1993; Fitts & Posner, 1967; Logan, 1988). One could infer from this framework of skill acquisition that novices might benefit from conditions that prompt attention to task properties yet not profit to the same extent in environments that divert attention away from the primary task at hand. In contrast, experienced performers may be harmed by explicit attention to skill processes that normally run as uninterrupted programs or procedures, yet they may not be adversely affected by conditions that draw attention away from performance. However, this may hold true only for those aspects of an experienced performer</SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F"
>The results of the present study conform quite well to these predictions derived from theories of skill acquisition. For right-foot dribbling, novices performed at a lower level in the dual-task condition, designed to distract attention from task performance, in comparison with the skill-focused manipulation, designed to draw attention toward the task at hand. Furthermore, novices substantially improved in dribbling speed from the single-task practice condition to the skill-focused condition. Experienced soccer players showed an opposite pattern of results. Experienced individuals performed at a lower level in the skill-focused condition compared with either the dual-task or practice condition. These results coincide with those of Experiment 1 and, as mentioned above, are consistent with current theories of choking under pressure (Beilock & Carr, 2001). </SPAN

>The findings of Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that skill-focused attention benefits less practiced and less proficient performances yet hinders performance at higher levels of skill execution. High-level skills are thought to become proceduralized or automated with extended practice. The encoding of task components in a proceduralized form supports effective real-time performance, without the need for constant online control. As a result, skill performance decrements occur in conditions that impose step-by-step monitoring and control on complex, procedural knowledge that would have operated more automatically and efficiently had such monitoring not intervened. Therefore, experienced performers suffer more than novices from conditions that call their attention to individual task components or elicit step-by-step monitoring and control. However, experienced performers are better able than novices to spare a portion of their attention for other stimuli and task demands, and hence are better able than novices to deal with conditions that create dual-task environments (e.g., taking a series of golf putts or dribbling a soccer ball while performing an auditory-monitoring task). As shown by the contrast between right-foot and left-foot dribbling, however, this may hold only for that portion of an experienced performers</SPAN

Researchers have recently suggested that attention to the step-by-step components of a novel skill may be detrimental to performance (Singer et al., 1993; Wulf et al., 1998, 2000). However, the present findings demonstrate that attention benefits both novel skill performance and performance that is not based on a heavily proceduralized knowledge representation, even though carried out by an experienced performer (e.g., experienced soccer players</SPAN

>It should be noted that the present study examined the performance of a golf-putting task and a soccer-dribbling skill under different attentional manipulations at approximately constant levels of performance, rather than examining the learning or transfer of these skills to novel task situations. For this reason it remains possible that under conditions commonly used to assess skill learning (e.g., transfer tests), a different pattern of performance may arise. Future research in this area would serve to shed light on this issue. </SPAN

>activities, including the allocation of attention to performance outcomes and goal attainment, self-evaluation, and self-reactions, detract from the lower level performances of novices yet enhance skill execution at later stages of learning and higher levels of proficiency. Self-regulatory activities are thought to require attentional capacity for successful initiation and implementation. Thus, self-regulation may disrupt novel skill execution by recruiting attentional resources needed for control of task performance (F. H. Kanfer & Stevenson, 1985). However, this may not be the case for more experienced performance that does not rely on constant attentional control. Instead, self-regulatory functions may be implementable in parallel with proceduralized control processes, serving to store information about the outcomes and evaluations of performance (rather than the unfolding of their step-by-step components) that is needed for subsequent cognitions about ones</SPAN

>’ </SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F"
>abilities, effort, and strategies for task control (R. Kanfer & Ackerman, 1989; Kluwe, 1987). We propose, then, that self-regulatory attention and skill-focused attention differ in a crucial way: Self-regulatory attention is metacognitive and aimed at the plans that precede skill execution and the products that follow skill execution (Brown, 1987), whereas skill-focused attention is cognitive and aimed at the component steps that constitute execution itself (Beilock & Carr, 2001). </SPAN

<SPAN style="font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F"
>If attention devoted to self-regulation is different from skill focus yet depends on some of the same attentional resources, then self-regulatory activities may provide a secondary, unintended benefit to experienced skill execution: Specifically, self-regulation applied to the plans, the outcomes, and the feelings accompanying performance may prevent individuals from paying too much attention to the step-by-step control of that performance as it unfolds in real time. It may be that individuals involved in self-regulatory functions do not have the resources available to explicitly attend to, monitor, or try to control particular steps or components of online performance</SPAN

><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F"
>a practice that was shown in the present study to disrupt high-level execution. Thus, although explicit attention to component steps of proceduralized performances may disrupt or dismantle optimal task execution at high levels of learning and proficiency, attentional processes that serve higher level, more metacognitive roles may instead promote optimal performance, both by focusing attention on plans and outcomes and also by preventing attention from focusing on step-by-step control of execution. </SPAN

>Furthermore, skill-focused attention may not always be detrimental to well-learned performances. The present study demonstrated that skill-focused attention applied to current real-time performance disrupts execution. However, if applied in other circumstances, such as practice situations, in which performers are consciously attempting to dismantle their skill and modify certain parts in accord with data collected by self-regulatory activities such as those mentioned above, skill-focused attention may actually be helpful. That is, when the goal is not to maximize real-time performance but instead to explicitly alter or change performance processes to achieve a different outcome, skill-focused attention may be beneficial. In this manner, skill-focused attention may become embedded in the metacognitive activities of self</SPAN
><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F"
>regulation. Specifically, individuals may attend to specific components of their skill (i.e., implement skill-focused attention) to alter control strategies and execution processes that, through self-regulatory actions, have been deemed unproductive or maladaptive to progress toward a desired goal state. Although this monitoring of performance may be temporarily detrimental to skill execution, as performers will most likely have to slow down and break down previous execution procedures to attend to and alter these processes, and then readapt to and proceduralize the new execution parameters, ultimately these changes should produce performance benefits as skill execution becomes more closely aligned with desired outcomes. </SPAN

>attention to task-relevant kinesthetic or perceptual cues. However, at later stages of performance, this type of attentional control may be detrimental, at least in situations where maximum performance is the desired real-time outcome. In the present study, experienced golfers and soccer players showed decrements in performance under conditions designed to prompt attention to step-by-step execution. Thus, it may be beneficial for experienced individuals to allocate attention to aspects of performance that are not directly involved in the online control of skill execution. McPherson (2000) demonstrated that successful, experienced tennis players spend a significant amount of time examining their own performance outcomes, as well as those of their opponents, as a tool for diagnosing and updating performance strategies and maintaining focus on the task at hand. At higher levels of practice, then, when attention may not be necessary for the online control of performance, such functions as strategizing about choices of actions not only may help to achieve desired goal-states but also may prevent individuals from over attending to well-learned performance processes and procedures. </SPAN
